/*
  Objects
  Objects in JavaScript are like object IRL.
  IRL, objects have characteristics and things
  that they can do.

/*
  IRL guitar
  characteristics = color, brand, model, number of strings
  things that it can do = jam, smash, strum, woo
*/

// In JavaScript, we call characteristics "properties"
// and we call things that an object can do "methods"

// A method is just a function that belongs to an object.

// creating objects
// object literal syntax
// key-value pairs

const guitar = {
  color: "blue",
  brand: "Fender",
  model: "Stratocaster",
  numberOfstrings: 6,
};

// object constructor
const guitar2 = object();
